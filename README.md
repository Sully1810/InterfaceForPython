# Overview

I wrote this software to create an interface for my SQL Database that I createad using Python. 

Below I have linked my YouTube video demonstartion.

# Development Environment

I worked primarily in VS Code with a lot of internet researching. 

I wrote this program in Python and used the PyQt6 libraries. 

# Useful Websites

- [Riverbank Computer](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)
Used for downloading PyQT. 
- [Python Guis](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt6-tutorial/)
Walked me through getting my interface set up. 
- [Qt Documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/widget-classes.html#basic-widget-classes)
Lists all the different widget class functions. 

# Future Work

This is what I hope to accomplish and fix in the future. 

- Finish integrating my SQL database into the interface
- Create a more cohesive color scheme 
- Work with PyQt6 again
